With new years just around the corner, I’m setting myself a small goal for the year 2015. I’ll start writing again. Yep, that’s right. Some of you know (yes you!) that I tried this a several time and it just fade away every time but there’s no harm in trying again for the 400th (whoa, maybe like 4th) time, no?

I’m not sure yet what I will write in here or what I will share, if I do share anything as you all know it will be related to my daily life as a UI Designer or a car addict. Maybe I’ll even let you in on the personal life huh? The point is to just write right? “Write right” hah… sounds funny.

Well then… this should be fun. Peace ~
